**tl;dr** - I have moved the writing I have created on my experiences with eating disorders to this site (and off of Medium.). You can find them [here](/eating-anthology).

For at least the past five years, my mental health has been affected through and alongside a weird relationship with food, exercise, and eating. I find writing helps me clarify my thoughts and my situation to me. While a lot of this writing is intentionally private, there are a couple of piece I want to be publicly available.

Back when I published my first piece on this subject, I put it on medium.com - however that site has recently favoured the advertiser over the reader. Back in 2016 it was very much the opposite, and while I understand they need to make money from people reading their writing - I don't, and so I can afford to favour the reader experience. When I've written something so personal and meaningful, I wanted people to read it in the same way.

So I have collated my writing into a small anthology, which you can find on my personal site, [here](/eating-anthology) or each piece individually at:

- 2016: [My Eating Disorder Was Dangerous Because It Was Powerful](/eating-anthology/2016)
- 2017: [Loss and my ED](/eating-anthology/2017)
- 2020: [My eating disorder will always remind me of the person I was, and am](/eating-anthology/2020)

I've left the initial pieces as untouched - with only some minor styling changes to bring some of the long lyrics I mention into life.
