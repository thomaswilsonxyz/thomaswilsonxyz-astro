After a year and a half of very new normal, summer 2021 was pretty perfect.  I mean, the weather wasn't summery, being around a lot of strangers (and even friends) felt odd, and there seemed an _awful_ lot of pressure to make this The Best Summer Ever.

I'm pretty grateful for a lot of small moments this summer.  

Here are some of those moments:

- Moved to Oxford and filled a moderate-sized house with an unwise number of plants 
- Climbed Helvellyn and Haystacks in the Lake District 
- Ate food outside with friends
- Ate food inside with family
- Watched campfires 
- Drank gin on hot evenings and cold nights from between clinking ice and wedges of citrus
- Cycled through sunny mornings and afternoons
