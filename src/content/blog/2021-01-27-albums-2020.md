Just a quick blog post to highlight that I've published my 2020 _Top Albums of the Year_. You can find it [here](/albums-2020). Seriously, go check it out.

I really enjoy making little specially art-directed pages like this. It feels very "this is what the internet was made for". It's just a quirky little bespoke designed page which oozes my love for music. No tracking, no adverts, just a quirky font and cool colour scheme.

If you want to take a look at last year's albums, check out my [Top Albums of 2019](/albums-2019)

Anyway, hope you're keeping well.
