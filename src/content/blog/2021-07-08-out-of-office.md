Summer has always been a time for _doing_ and living.  It doesn't feel right to force at least one piece of writing out of my brain every week.  Discipline and routine are useful tools for living, but so is taking a summer break.  I'm going out of office for the next couple of months, so I can focus on the latter.  I want long cycles, solitary train rides, food eaten outdoors, and adventure.  This is what summer is for.


So there will be less writing in public, and more living in private for a little while.  It's been a weird 18 months with a pandemic, but this year I feel I can have a more "normal" summer.  So I'm going to do that.  Shame that I won't be going to Florence, though. 

Take care and stay safe, I'll be back when the days start drawing in ✌️
